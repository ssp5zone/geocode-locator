# Geo Location via Google Maps api

Get Latitude-Longitude of a place via place name or map position.

**Note:** I have given my Google Maps API key for demo, which probably might already be exhausted. So, use your own key.

## Build

Just replace my google maps api key with your own in `locator.html`.

## Run

Download and open file locator.html.
